# FUNCTIONS' SECTIONS ANSWERS

## Q2: What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
Ans: The parameters of a function are the variables a function expects while the arguments are the values that are actually passsed to it. Parameters of a function are defined while defining the function while the arguments are send while a function is actually called.
